# SpeakoAI Mock Data Population

This directory contains scripts to populate the SpeakoAI backend with realistic mock data for testing and development.

## 📁 Files

- `populate_mock_data.py` - Main Python script that creates mock data

# If you prefer to run manually
docker-compose exec backend python populate_mock_data.py
```

## 🔧 Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed
- Backend container must be running
- Database must be accessible

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Backend not running
```bash
# Start the backend first
docker-compose up -d backend
```

### Permission denied (Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x populate_data.sh
```

### Database connection issues
```bash
# Check if database is running
docker-compose ps

# Restart backend if needed
docker-compose restart backend
```

## 📈 After Running

Once the script completes successfully, you can:

1. **Test the Frontend**: The frontend will now have real questions to display
2. **Test AI Scoring**: Submit answers through the frontend to test the AI scoring
3. **View Data**: Check the database to see all created mock data

## 🔄 Re-running

You can run the script multiple times. It will:
- Create new users (if they don't exist)
- Create new questions (if they don't exist)
- Create new responses and feedback

The script is designed to be idempotent - running it multiple times won't create duplicate data.

## 🎯 Next Steps

After populating the data:
1. Start your frontend: `cd SpeakoAIfront/speakoai && npm run dev`
2. Start your backend: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Test the full application with real data!
